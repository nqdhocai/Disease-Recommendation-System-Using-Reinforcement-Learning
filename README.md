## Introduction

The Disease Recommendation System Using Reinforcement Learning is a project that aims to develop a system capable of recommending potential diseases based on patient symptoms. By leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, the system continuously improves its recommendation accuracy through interaction and feedback.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies for this project, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Reinforcement Learning Agent

1. Train the reinforcement learning agent on the processed data:

    ```bash
    python src/train_agent.py
    ```
## Results

The results of the reinforcement learning-based recommendation system include the accuracy and efficiency of disease predictions. The system's performance is evaluated and visualized to understand its effectiveness and areas for improvement.
